# Model_demo

# Demonstrates the model logic for cell division as described in: Growth plasticity in the face of persistent cross-generational stress determines cell size in melanoma
# Shows a simple stable means by which a cell population can maintain a size distribution

# The alpha or a parameters seen throughtout represent the probabilty of division per cell area
# k is a proportionality constant between size and growth rate
# L is a/k
